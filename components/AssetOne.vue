              <p class="text-md">We also built a native android app for drivers to use during the day, to see their upcoming jobs,
                    and get detailed job info. The app automatically tracks the driver via gps, and updates their
                    status as they progress through the various stages of completing a job. This then updates
                    their status in the main app, so dispatchers can monitor their progress.</p>

            <p class="text-md">This project has been a huge success, with a return on initial investment within 7 months
                  of launch. This is mostly due to less errors now being made with invoicing, with the
                  app automating much of this process. Next steps are to roll out a SAAS version for other
                  compaines to use.
